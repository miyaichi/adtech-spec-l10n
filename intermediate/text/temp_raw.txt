Sellers.json
July 2019

Abstract
As part of a broader effort to eliminate the ability to profit from counterfeit inventory in the open
digital advertising ecosystem, Sellers.json provides a mechanism to enable buyers to discover
who the entities are that are either direct sellers of or intermediaries in the selling of digital
advertising.

Introduction
Ads.txt has been extremely successful in allowing publisher content distributors and app
publishers to define who is authorized to sell a given set of impressions (publisher’s advertising
inventory) via a bid request. Ads.txt does not, however, make any attempt at revealing the
identities of the publisher account IDs within their advertising platform(s) (Publisher's SSPSupply-Side Platform).
A published and accessible Sellers.json file allows the identity of the final seller of a bid request
to be discovered (assuming that they are ads.txt authorized). It also allows the identities of all

nodes (entities that participated in the bid request) in the SupplyChain object to be discovered.
Currently, it is possible for the final seller to be identified via the Publisher.name and
Publisher.domain attributes, but in practice, these properties are inconsistently populated by
various selling systems.
Sellers.json enables smaller bid request object sizes by allowing this information to be looked
up and cached “offline” rather than supplied with every bid request. Sellers.json also allows the
identification of any and all intermediaries that participated in the selling of a bid request.

Audience
Advertising systems, whether they are sellers or buyers of programmatic advertising both
benefit from a transparent marketplace where all parties to the transaction are well understood.
This document serves to define the information that sellers will provide to both downstream
sellers and buyers of programmatic inventory.

First Version

SPECIFICATION
This document specifies a mechanism for advertising systems to publicly declare the sellers that
they represent and those sellers’ identifiers within their systems. It also describes the format for
encoding the instructions to be consumed by advertising systems and their customers.

ACCESS METHOD
Advertising systems should post the sellers.json file on their root domain and any subdomains
as needed. For the purposes of this document the “root domain” is defined as the “public suffix”
plus one string in the name. Crawlers should incorporate Public Suffix list [16] to derive the root
domain.
The declarations must be accessible via HTTP and/or HTTPS from the website where the
instructions are to be applied under a standard relative path on the server host: "/sellers.json"
and HTTP request header containing "Content-Type: application/json". Additionally, you could
use "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" to explicitly signal UTF8 support.

Also, HTTPS connections over HTTP are preferred when crawling sellers.json files. In any case,
where data is available at both an HTTPS and an HTTP connection for the same URL, the data
from HTTPS should be preferred.
For convenience we will refer to this resource as the "/sellers.json" file. Despite the use of the
word "file," the resource need not originate from a file system.
If the server response indicates Success (HTTP 2xx Status Code,) the advertising system must
read the content, parse it, and utilize the declarations.
If the server response indicates an HTTP/HTTPS redirect (301, 302, 307 status codes), the
advertising system should follow the redirect and consume the data as authoritative for the
source of the redirect, if and only if the redirect is within the scope of the original root domain
defined as the public suffix plus one string in the name as defined above. Multiple redirects are
valid as long as each redirect location remains within the original root domain. For example an
HTTP to HTTPS redirect within the same root domain is valid.
Only a single HTTP redirect to a destination outside the original root domain is allowed to
facilitate one-hop delegation of authority to a third party's web server domain. If the third party
location returns a redirect, then the advertising system should treat the response as an error. A
future version may address other delegation of authority to a third-party web server, but for now
redirects to a third-party web server and any other redirect should be interpreted as an error and
ignored.
If the server response indicates the resource does not exist (HTTP Status Code 404) or for any
other HTTP error, the last successfully retrieved data set should be utilized.

FILE FORMAT
All data in the file is serialized using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The parent JSON
object and all child objects are written to the sellers.json file.

EXPIRATION
Consuming systems of /sellers.json should cache the files, but if they do they must periodically
verify the cached copy is fresh before using its contents.
Standard HTTP cache-control mechanisms can be used by both origin server and robots to
influence the caching of the /sellers.json file. Specifically consumers and replicators should take
note of HTTP Expires header set by the origin server.
If no cache-control directives are present, consuming systems should default to an expiry of 7
days.

Implementation
Every advertising system listed in an ads.txt file and any advertising system that is referenced
from a SupplyChain object node should publish a Sellers.json file at the following location:
http://{advertising_system_domain}/sellers.json

Object specifications
Object: Parent
The Parent object is the top-level object of a Sellers.json file. It is a container for all properties in
a sellers.json file.

Attribute

Type

Description

sellers

object array; required

The list of all Seller objects that are
represented by the advertising
system. All sellers must be included
even if they are confidential.

identifiers

object array; optional

Array of Identifier objects associated
with this advertising system.
Examples could be TAG-Ids, Dun &
Bradstreet business identifiers, or
any custom identifier that a
consuming advertising system might
need.

contact_email

string; optional

An email address to use to contact
the Advertising System for
questions or inquiries about this file.

contact_address

string; optional

The business address of the
advertising system.

version

string; required

The version of this spec, currently
the only valid value is 1.0.

ext

object; optional

Placeholder for advertising-system
specific extensions to this object.

Sellers.json object: Identifier
An identifier is an arbitrary name/value pair that is used to communicate common values such
as business identifiers, certification identifiers, or any other identifier that a consuming system
might need to better interoperate with the seller.
Standard Identifiers are listed in the section Identifier Names below.
Attribute

Type

Description

name

string; required

The description of the identifier

value

string; required

The value of the identifier

Sellers.json object: Seller
The identification of the selling legal entity that is paid for inventory sold on behalf of seller_id.
It is invalid for a seller_id to represent multiple entities. Every seller_id must map to only a single
entity that is paid for inventory transacted with that seller_id. It is valid for a selling entity to have
multiple seller_ids within an advertising system.
Attribute

Type

Description

seller_id

string; required

This is the same ID that appears in
an ads.txt file and in the
SupplyChain.nodes array sid
property. In most cases will also
appear in the Publisher.Id property
of an OpenRTB request.

is_confidential

integer; optional, default 0

Indicates whether the identity of the
seller is confidential, where 0 = is
not confidential and 1 = is
confidential.

seller_type

string; required

An enumeration of the type of
account, either PUBLISHER,
INTERMEDIARY, or BOTH.
A value of "PUBLISHER" indicates
that the inventory sold through this
account is on a site, app, or other
medium owned by the named entity
and the advertising system pays
them directly.
A value of “INTERMEDIARY"
indicates that the inventory sold
through this account is not owned
by the named entity or the
advertising system does not pay
them directly. 'BOTH' indicates that

both types of inventory are
transacted by this seller. Note that
this field should be treated as case
insensitive when interpreting the
data.
is_passthrough

integer; optional, default 0

A passthrough seller is a facilitator
of inventory from the upstream
supplier to the consumer of the
inventory. The upstream supplier
and consumer must establish a
business relationship with each
other such that the upstream
supplier has control of their account
within the consumer’s platform.
A value of 1 indicates the following:
- This seller has an account control
relationship with the
downstream/consuming advertising
system.
- If this seller is the last link in a
SupplyChain, the buying system has
to have established an account
control relationship with this seller to
transact the seller’s inventory.
- If this is not the last link in a
SupplyChain than this seller should
exist between two entities that have
an account control relationship.
A value of 0 indicates:
- The downstream/consuming
advertising system has no account
control relationship with this seller.

name

string; required when
is_confidential=0

The name of the company (the legal
entity) that is paid for inventory that
is transacted under the given
seller_id. Can be omitted only when
is_confidential is set to 1.

domain

string; required if seller has a web
presence and is_confidential=0

The business domain name of the
company (the legal entity) that is
paid for inventory that is transacted
under the given seller_id. When the
seller_type property is set to
INTERMEDIARY or BOTH, this
should be the root domain name of
the seller’s Sellers.json file. Can be
omitted when is_confidential is set
to 1 or when the seller doesn’t have
a web presence.

comment

string; optional

Any helpful description for this
inventory. It is useful for sellers that
have multiple seller ids to describe
what this seller_id represents.

ext

object; optional

Placeholder for advertising-system
specific extensions to this object.

Note that domain in sellers.json and SupplyChain are to be populated with only the root
domain and not a full URL, much like ‘domain’ in OpenRTB’s Site object and the domain
definition used for ads.txt. For the purposes of this document the “root domain” is defined as the
“public suffix” plus one string in the name. Implementers should incorporate Public Suffix list [16]
to derive the root domain.

Enumerated List Specification
Identifier Names
The following list defines standard identifiers that should be used in the identifier list.
